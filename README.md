# SQL-Challenge
Coding on SQL
Analyzed data and the relationships between 6 different csv files regarding employees and their corresponding departments, personal information, and salaries.
Became well-adjusted to navigating through pgAdmin4 and learned how to create schemas. I learned the importance of making sure the table schemas are accurate as that will make or break your ability to import data into SQL.
Learned how to analyze the data once it was imported and grab specific information when instructed.
